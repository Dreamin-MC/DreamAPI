### 🧠 Overview

**DreamAPI** is a **comprehensive and modular API** designed as the **technical foundation** for the entire **Dreamin Ecosystem**.
Built for **Minecraft Paper 26.2.1**, it provides a rich set of tools and abstractions for creating **advanced plugins** with **minimal boilerplate** and **maximum flexibility**.

---

### ⚡ Key Features

- 🎯 **Multi-Module Architecture** — Composed of `api`, `core`, and `plugin-base` for clean separation.
- 🎨 **Rich API Surface** — Includes systems for animations, GUIs, commands, configs, databases, dialogs, events, and more.
- 🎮 **Game-Ready Components** — Built-in support for inventories, items, recipes, glowing effects, and game mechanics.
- 🔌 **Plugin Foundation** — Base classes and utilities to accelerate plugin development.
- 🌐 **HTTP & Database Integration** — Native support for external APIs and data persistence.
- 🧩 **Service Architecture** — Dependency injection and service management for scalable plugins.
- 🪶 **Performance Optimized** — Leveraging modern Java 21 features and Paper APIs.
- 🛠️ **Developer Experience** — Includes Lombok, annotations, and intuitive builders.

---

### 🧭 Project Goal

DreamAPI aims to provide a **production-ready foundation** for Minecraft plugin development by:
- offering **reusable components** for common plugin needs (GUIs, commands, configs, etc.),
- establishing **consistent patterns** and **best practices** across the Dreamin ecosystem,
- reducing **boilerplate code** through annotations and builders,
- enabling **rapid prototyping** with pre-built systems,
- ensuring **compatibility** and **interoperability** between all Dreamin modules.

DreamAPI powers **all projects in the Dreamin ecosystem**, including [DreamHud](https://github.com/Dreamin-MC/DreamHud), and is **battle-tested in production**.
